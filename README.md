# Agents Hub

A native macOS app for managing reusable API providers and applying Claude Code or Codex profiles to local CLI configuration files.

</div>

---

## Requirements

- macOS 15 or later
- Claude Code CLI and/or Codex CLI, if you want Agents Hub to apply profiles to those tools

Agents Hub stores providers and profiles locally, then writes the selected Claude Code or Codex profile into each tool's existing configuration location.

The app supports automatic updates via Sparkle. You can also check for updates manually from the app menu or `Settings` -> `About`.

## Quick Start

1. Open Agents Hub.
2. Open `Providers` and add or edit a provider with its Base URL, provider website, and one or more named API keys.
3. Select `Claude Code` or `Codex` from the sidebar.
4. Click `Add Configuration`.
5. Choose the `API Provider`, select a `Provider Key` when the provider has multiple keys, and set the model fields for that agent.
6. Click `Set Current` to apply the selected profile.
7. Open `Overview` and click `Refresh` to check endpoint status and local tool versions.

## Manage Providers

Providers are shared API connection records that Claude Code and Codex profiles can reuse.

- Save a provider name, Base URL, and optional provider website.
- Add multiple named keys to one provider for different channels or accounts.
- Duplicate and delete providers from the `Providers` page.
- Reassign profiles automatically to a fallback provider when a provider or key is removed.

## Manage API Profiles

- Keep separate saved profile lists for Claude Code and Codex.
- Add, duplicate, delete, and rename agent configurations.
- Select a shared API provider and provider key for each profile.
- Store model and provider-specific model options per profile.
- Mark one profile as current for each agent.
- Reveal the target configuration files in Finder.

API keys are stored in the local Agents Hub state file through provider keys and are also written to the target CLI configuration files when a profile is applied.

## Configure Claude Code

Claude Code profiles are written to `~/.claude/settings.json`.

| Field | Written value |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.model` | selected profile model |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | selected profile API key |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | selected profile base URL |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | selected profile model |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | default Opus model |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | default Sonnet model |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | default Haiku model |

Agents Hub removes `env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when applying Claude Code profiles, so Claude Code uses `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` from the selected provider key.

Claude Code also has a shared `Skip Claude Onboarding` setting. When enabled, Agents Hub updates `~/.claude.json` and sets `hasCompletedOnboarding` to `true`.

## Configure Codex

Codex profiles are written to `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.codex/auth.json`.

| File | Written value |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` | selected model and `model_providers.agents-hub` provider settings |
| `~/.codex/auth.json` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the selected profile |

Agents Hub writes Codex profiles with `wire_api = "responses"` and `requires_openai_auth = true`. The managed Codex provider ID is always `model_providers.agents-hub`; its display name can be either `Agents Hub` or the selected profile name.

Codex also has a shared `Disable Codex Automatic Updates` setting. When enabled, Agents Hub writes Codex Desktop Sparkle defaults and sets `SUEnableAutomaticChecks` and `SUAutomaticallyUpdate` to `false`.

## Codex Desktop Patch Capabilities

The Codex page can inspect and patch Codex Desktop installations found at `/Applications/Codex.app` or `~/Applications/Codex.app`. Before applying a patch, Agents Hub backs up `Contents/Resources/app.asar` and `Contents/Info.plist`, applies version-matched same-length replacements, updates the Electron asar hash in `Info.plist`, ad-hoc re-signs the app with Electron JIT entitlements, and supports restoring the backup.

Current patch capabilities:

- `Fast Mode`: enables the local Fast mode UI gate.
- `Plugins`: enables local plugin and skills entry points, including plugin page, detail, availability, and install-flow gates.

Recommended usage flow:

1. Fully quit Codex Desktop.
2. Return to Agents Hub and apply the selected Codex Desktop patches.
3. Reopen Codex Desktop and start using the enabled capabilities.

Both capabilities have been tested and verified OK with Codex Desktop `26.519.41501`. These patches do not bypass Codex account, workspace, admin, or service-tier requirements.

## Check Local Status

The `Overview` page shows:

- endpoint health and latency for the current Claude Code and Codex profiles
- local `claude` and `codex` CLI versions
- installed Claude Desktop and Codex Desktop app versions

Use `Refresh` to re-run API checks and local version detection.

## Configuration Files

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/agents-hub/profiles.json` | Agents Hub provider, key, profile, and shared settings storage |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code settings written by Claude Code profiles |
| `~/.claude.json` | Claude Code onboarding state when the shared setting is enabled |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` | Codex model and provider configuration |
| `~/.codex/auth.json` | Codex API key auth payload |
| `~/.config/agents-hub/codex-desktop-backups` | Codex Desktop patch backups |
